      		<h3>Detail Information</h3>
	      		<p>Bodybuilding is the use of progressive resistance exercise to control and develop one's musculature.An individual who engages in this activity is referred to as a bodybuilder. In professional bodybuilding, bodybuilders appear in lineups and perform specified poses (and later individual posing routines) for a panel of judges who rank the competitors based on criteria such as symmetry, muscularity, and conditioning. Bodybuilders prepare for competitions through a combination of intentional dehydration, elimination of nonessential body fat, and carbohydrate loading to achieve maximum vascularity, as well as tanning to accentuate muscular definition.<br/>

The winner of the annual IFBB Mr. Olympia contest is generally recognized as the world's top male professional bodybuilder. The title is currently held by Phil Heath, who has won every year from 2011 to 2016. The winner of the Women's Physique portion of the competition is widely regarded as the world's top female professional bodybuilder. The title is currently held by Juliana Malacarne, who has won every year since 2014. Since 1950, the NABBA Universe Championships have been considered the top amateur bodybuilding contests, with notable winners such as Reg Park, Lee Priest, Steve Reeves, and Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p>

            <h3>Our Goals</h3>
<p>One of my first performance goals was to be able to do an unbroken set of 15 pull-ups without any assistance and in good form. That might sound like a lofty goal, and it didn't come overnight.

My best advice: Fake it 'til you make it. I started off on the assist, and then worked my way up to a spotter, and then I would kick and jump and take breaks to reach my first set of 15. After a few months—pounding, drenched in sweat, straining every muscle to keep good form—I finally had a breakthrough. I obliterated the goal hanging above my head.

Know which muscles you want to target, and which exercises work best to activate those muscles to continue to build strength. Once you reach your goal or hit a plateau, take a minute to re-evaluate. Is the goal realistic for you? You can always revise.

Your goals don't have to be tied to specific sets and reps like mine. Maybe your focus is on better form or heavier resistance. Anything achievement-based works.<br/>

Progress goals address your roadmap to success. This includes things such as your training calendar and nutrition plan. Make a schedule to stay consistent and identify how much training is necessary for progress to happen.

For example, you might aim to weight train five days each week, do cardio three days per week, and watch your daily caloric intake—which is sometimes the hardest goal to keep.

Training should always be consistent. I train year-round, but in order to be show-ready, I need at least six weeks of pre-competition programmed nutrition, lifting, and cardio.<br/>
These goals reflect your personal investment in the process—outside of the gym. Use these goals to address other areas of your personal life that can benefit or harm your progress.

Be realistic about your weaknesses and set obstacles to overcome. I usually have a great first two weeks into my goal setting, and then I need a pep talk. Here's where personal goals come in.

One of my goals was to stop weighing myself, which why my scale now resides in the top shelf of my closet.

My other goal was to resist my tendency to overtrain. Mentally, I had to push past the instant gratification and number on the scale that drove me. To remedy overtraining, I set a goal for off days and left myself room to postpone a workout that fell on a night I was working a long shift. I also set a goal to be more social.

I made it a point to not turn down an invitation out to eat. Instead, I'd choose healthier items on the menu or, if necessary, bring my own food.<br/>
While they're often set first to address how you want to approach your plan, outcome goals represent your finish line, your peak, your final result. These goals should be set first. This will allow you to set smaller goals leading to your desired outcome.My goal has been and still is to achieve my pro card. I just don't let that goal consume me anymore. I've asked myself what is really important and have reconstructed these goals to be along the lines of simply, "Get on stage!"</p>
