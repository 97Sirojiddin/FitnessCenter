    text=['This building  is inside of the new workplace. It has very excellent condition for users. Thera are so many equipments in the building.The gym, which will have almost 200 pieces of equipment and open training space, has been named "FITNESS CENTER".This pioneering new centre will provide unrivalled opportunities for everyone from beginner to elite athletes, supported by a world-class team of trainers and sports experts. It will be a home for our many sports clubs, allowing them to train and compete at the highest level.It will also have one of the most extensive and advanced centres in part to the quality and range of equipment, and supporting expertise. It will be an important centre for community health and well-being, and substantial effort has been made to ensure all facilities are as accessible as possible for those with disabilities, injuries or other specific access requirements.It features over 200 stations across two floors, and highly qualified staff whose mission it is to inspire you to discover how strong, how fast and how hard you can go. In addition to the state of the art equipment, this brand new gym has been designed to include open space where you can unleash yourself and undertake a whole body, functional workout.',
    'This is our new teacher. he teaches beginner course. He has many honours in this field. He has very valuable experience.He has these vital skills:Customer-service skills. Many fitness trainers and instructors must sell their services, motivating clients to hire them as personal trainers or to sign up for the classes they lead. Fitness trainers and instructors must therefore be polite, friendly, and encouraging to maintain relationships with their clients.Listening skills. To keep clients coming back for more classes or to continue personal training, fitness trainers and instructors must keep their clients motivated.Physical fitness. Fitness trainers and instructors need to be physically fit because their job requires a considerable amount of exercise. Group instructors often participate in classes, and personal trainers often need to show exercises to their clients.Problem-solving skills. Fitness trainers and instructors must evaluate each client’s level of fitness and create an appropriate fitness plan to meet the client’s individual needs.Speaking skills. Fitness trainers and instructors must be able to communicate well because they need to be able to explain exercises and movements to clients, as well as motivate them verbally during exercises.These skils is an essential for every trainers.therefore, we can prove you by showing these information.','This place is for boxing course. It has new equipment for the users. It has modern designed for the users.There are basic boxing gyms, and then there’s BXR. The brand new boutique boxing concept in Uzbek ,Tashkent  is of course a “boxing gym in the fitness center”, but that descriptor itself doesn’t do it justice. Backed by Hasanboy Dusmatov, with Shahram Giyasov and Ildar Madrahimov on the committee and Victoria’s Secret models as members, the 12,000sq ft space feels more like a luxury hotel or a gentleman’s club than a gym.Split over two floors, BXR has an in-house clinic - complete with a multi-disciplinary team of world-leading experts - three pay-to-train "Sweat by BXR" studios, and then a gym floor set around a professionally sized boxing ring, vintage leather punch bags and more state-of-the-art equipment than you could possibly use in a full week of workouts. The BXR matra is “train like a champion”, but that’s not to say that boxing novices aren’t as welcome as AJ’s peers. No matter what level your sparring skills are at, if you’re ready to work hard - and have fun while doing - it you’ll fit right in.For all the unbelievable interiors and cutting-edge kit, it’s the boxing trainers that make this the place to practice your punches. If you want to work on your technique, try a one-on-one session before getting stuck into the classes, which cover everything from technique to boxing conditioning.','Recently new equipments came to our workplace. It is great news for all people who are doing it.Exercise equipment is any apparatus or device used during physical activity to enhance the strength or conditioning effects of that exercise by providing either fixed or adjustable amounts of resistance, or to otherwise enhance the experience or outcome of an exercise routine.Exercise equipment may also include such wearable items as proper footgear, gloves, and hydration packs.It is important to use exercise equipment properly along with a personal trainer. Inappropriate use of equipment can lead to injuries from mild to extreme.A broad range of different types of exercise equipment are available, including Free weights such as dumbbells, kettle bells, barbells; Resistance bands, Flexion machines, Pull-up bars, Weight machines','She is new woman teacher for intermediate and beginner in yoga and fitness course. She has great valuable experience in these field. She is 25 years old.She has the ability to motivate individuals and groups and good speaking and listening skills and personal fitness, strength and flexibility and commercial skills. She works part - time in our center. She has 2 years experience of practising and teaching fitness in qualified center.','Tis is our new online course. We recently open this course for all people. The main reason of this course is that Yoga as exercise is a modern phenomenon which has been influenced by the ancient Indian practice of hatha yoga. It involves holding stretches as a kind of low-impact physical exercise, and is often used for therapeutic purposes.Yoga in this sense often occurs in a class and may involve meditation, imagery, breath work and music. A passion for practicing yoga turns into a passion for sharing yoga. You become a “yoga junkie” – seeking out classes, workshops, even retreats to deepen your practice and discover more about yourself.You may also find yourself working opposite hours from your family + friends. Consider this – the most popular classes are often early morning (before people head off to work) and in the evenings (the coveted 5:30 and 7:00 time spots) after work. Maybe not a huge deal at first… but I’ve heard from many yogis that. '
